# vibebot
Discord Bot made for Tetrium's Server - now global!

Based on some reminders/interactions from Tetrium's server, I made this bot for that! To remind you certain days of the week that is...
Well, I can't tell you. You have to invite the bot and figure it out yourself!

Few things to keep in mind:

For the bot to actually send the reminders, people with "Administrator" perms need to set a channel using /set-channel. You can unsub at any time with the /unsubscribe command as well!

Happy reminders!
